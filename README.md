## General Information
The REST API application is a separate module of the Sportowe Świry application (available at [here](https://sportoweswiry.com.pl/)) that allows to access the database using the HTTP protocol. The app should use a copy of the original application database. This is a module designed to show the functionality of the API.

## Technologies Used
* Framework Python-Flask
* SQLAlchemy
* Pytest
* MySQL
* AWS
* Postman
* Git


## Features
The user, after logging in (JWT Token), has access to all his sports activities and events saved in the database. He can also view, add, delete and update his previous activities. The user can also update his personal data from this application.
Users who are administrators can view all registered users and other data related to them (activities, events).

Data is transmitted and displayed using the JSON format. Displaying a list of activities, events or users can be configured according to your needs:

* Filtering specific database columns ("field" parameter)
* Sorting by selected columns ("sort" parameter)
* Search for specific values in database columns
* The use of pagination when displaying data
